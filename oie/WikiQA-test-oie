Q292	D291	American wire gauge	D291-1-0	The cross-sectional area of each gauge is an important factor for determining its current-carrying capacity .
Q292	D291	American wire gauge	D291-2-0	The steel industry does not use AWG and prefers a number of other wire gauges.

Q292	D291	American wire gauge	D291-4-0	Increasing gauge numbers give decreasing wire diameters, which is similar to many other non- metric gauging systems.

Q1338	D1278	Data deduplication	D1278-6-0	This type of deduplication is different from that performed by standard file-compression tools, such as LZ77 and LZ78 .
Q1338	D1278	Data deduplication	D1278-7-0	Whereas these tools identify short repeated substrings inside individual files, the intent of storage-based data deduplication is to inspect large volumes of data and identify large sections – such as entire files or large sections of files – that are identical, in order to store only one copy of it.
Q1338	D1278	Data deduplication	D1278-8-0	This copy may be additionally compressed by single-file compression techniques.
Q1338	D1278	Data deduplication	D1278-9-0	For example a typical email system might contain 100 instances of the same one megabyte (MB) file attachment.
Q1338	D1278	Data deduplication	D1278-10-0	Each time the email platform is backed up, all 100 instances of the attachment are saved, requiring 100 MB storage space.
Q1338	D1278	Data deduplication	D1278-11-0	With data deduplication, only one instance of the attachment is actually stored; the subsequent instances are referenced back to the saved copy for deduplication ratio of roughly 100 to 1.

Q2931	D2712	OpenID	D2712-0-0	The OpenID logo
Q2931	D2712	OpenID	D2712-1-0	OpenID is an open standard that allows users to be authenticated by certain co-operating sites (known as Relying Parties or RP) using a third party service, eliminating the need for webmasters to provide their own ad hoc systems and allowing users to consolidate their digital identities .
Q2931	D2712	OpenID	D2712-2-0	Users may create accounts with their preferred OpenID identity providers , and then use those accounts as the basis for signing on to any website which accepts OpenID authentication.
Q2931	D2712	OpenID	D2712-3-0	The OpenID standard provides a framework for the communication that must take place between the identity provider and the OpenID acceptor (the "relying party").
Q2931	D2712	OpenID	D2712-4-0	An extension to the standard (the OpenID Attribute Exchange) facilitates the transfer of user attributes, such as name and gender, from the OpenID identity provider to the relying party (each relying party may request a different set of attributes, depending on its requirements).
Q2931	D2712	OpenID	D2712-5-0	The OpenID protocol does not rely on a central authority to authenticate a user's identity.
Q2931	D2712	OpenID	D2712-6-0	Moreover, neither services nor the OpenID standard may mandate a specific means by which to authenticate users, allowing for approaches ranging from the common (such as passwords) to the novel (such as smart cards or biometrics ).
Q2931	D2712	OpenID	D2712-7-0	The term OpenID may also refer to an identifier as specified in the OpenID standard; these identifiers take the form of a unique URI , and are managed by some 'OpenID provider' that handles authentication.

Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-0-0	Atherosclerosis (also known as arteriosclerotic vascular disease or ASVD) is a condition in which an artery wall thickens as a result of the accumulation of fatty materials such as cholesterol and triglyceride .
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-1-0	It is a syndrome affecting arterial blood vessels , a chronic inflammatory response in the walls of arteries, caused largely by the accumulation of macrophage white blood cells and promoted by low-density lipoproteins (LDL, plasma proteins that carry cholesterol and triglycerides ) without adequate removal of fats and cholesterol from the macrophages by functional high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (see apoA-1 Milano ).
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-2-0	It is commonly referred to as a hardening or furring of the arteries.
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-3-0	It is caused by the formation of multiple plaques within the arteries.
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-4-0	The atheromatous plaque is divided into three distinct components:
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-5-0	The atheroma ("lump of gruel," from ἀθήρα, athera, gruel in Greek), which is the nodular accumulation of a soft, flaky, yellowish material at the center of large plaques, composed of macrophages nearest the lumen of the artery
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-6-0	Underlying areas of cholesterol crystals
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-7-0	Calcification at the outer base of older more advanced lesions .
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-8-0	The following terms are similar, yet distinct, in both spelling and meaning, and can be easily confused: arteriosclerosis , arteriolosclerosis , and atherosclerosis.
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-9-0	Arteriosclerosis is a general term describing any hardening (and loss of elasticity) of medium or large arteries (from the Greek arteria , meaning artery, and , meaning hardening); arteriolosclerosis is any hardening (and loss of elasticity) of arterioles (small arteries); atherosclerosis is a hardening of an artery specifically due to an atheromatous plaque.
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-10-0	The term atherogenic is used for substances or processes that cause atherosclerosis.
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-11-0	Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease that remains asymptomatic for decades.
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-12-0	Atherosclerotic lesions, or atherosclerotic plaques are separated into two broad categories: Stable and unstable (also called vulnerable).
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-13-0	The pathobiology of atherosclerotic lesions is very complicated but generally, stable atherosclerotic plaques, which tend to be asymptomatic, are rich in extracellular matrix and smooth muscle cells , while, unstable plaques are rich in macrophages and foam cells and the extracellular matrix separating the lesion from the arterial lumen (also known as the fibrous cap ) is usually weak and prone to rupture.
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-14-0	Ruptures of the fibrous cap expose thrombogenic material, such as collagen to the circulation and eventually induce thrombus formation in the lumen.
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-15-0	Upon formation, intraluminal thrombi can occlude arteries outright (i.e. coronary occlusion), but more often they detach, move into the circulation and eventually occlude smaller downstream branches causing thromboembolism (i.e. Stroke is often caused by thrombus formation in the carotid arteries).
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-16-0	Apart from thromboembolism , chronically expanding atherosclerotic lesions can cause complete closure of the lumen.
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-17-0	Interestingly, chronically expanding lesions are often asymptomatic until lumen stenosis is so severe that blood supply to downstream tissue(s) is insufficient resulting in ischemia .
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-18-0	These complications of advanced atherosclerosis are chronic, slowly progressive and cumulative.
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-19-0	Most commonly, soft plaque suddenly ruptures (see vulnerable plaque ), causing the formation of a thrombus that will rapidly slow or stop blood flow, leading to death of the tissues fed by the artery in approximately 5 minutes.
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-20-0	This catastrophic event is called an infarction .
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-21-0	One of the most common recognized scenarios is called coronary thrombosis of a coronary artery , causing myocardial infarction (a heart attack).
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-22-0	The same process in an artery to the brain is commonly called stroke .
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-23-0	Another common scenario in very advanced disease is claudication from insufficient blood supply to the legs, typically caused by a combination of both stenosis and aneurysmal segments narrowed with clots .
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-24-0	Atherosclerosis affects the entire artery tree, but mostly larger, high-pressure vessels such as the coronary, renal, femoral, cerebral, and carotid arteries.
Q2933	D2714	Atherosclerosis	D2714-25-0	These are termed " clinically silent " because the person having the infarction does not notice the problem and does not seek medical help, or when they do, physicians do not recognize what has happened.
