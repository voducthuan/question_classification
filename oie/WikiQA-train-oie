Q114	D114	G-force	D114-5-0	This is a horizontal acceleration of 5.3 g. Combined with the vertical g-force in the stationary case the Pythagorean theorem yields a g force of 5.4 g.
Q114	D114	G-force	D114-6-0	g-force (with g from gravitational) is a term for accelerations felt as weight and measurable by accelerometers .
Q114	D114	G-force	D114-7-0	It is not a force, per se, but a force per unit mass.
Q114	D114	G-force	D114-8-0	Since such a force is perceived as a weight, any g-force can be described as a "weight per unit mass" (see the synonym specific weight ).
Q114	D114	G-force	D114-9-0	The g-force acceleration acts as a multiplier of weight-like forces for every unit of an object's mass, and (save for certain electromagnetic force influences) is the cause of an object's acceleration in relation to free-fall .
Q114	D114	G-force	D114-10-0	This acceleration experienced by an object is due to the vector sum of non-gravitational forces acting on an object free to move.
Q114	D114	G-force	D114-11-0	The accelerations that are not produced by gravity are termed proper accelerations , and it is only these that are measured in g-force units.
Q114	D114	G-force	D114-12-0	They cause stresses and strains on objects.
Q114	D114	G-force	D114-13-0	Because of these strains, large g-forces may be destructive.
Q114	D114	G-force	D114-14-0	Gravitation acting alone does not produce a g-force, even though g-forces are expressed in multiples of the acceleration of a standard gravity.
Q114	D114	G-force	D114-15-0	Thus, the standard gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface produces g-force only indirectly, as a result of resistance to it by mechanical forces.
Q114	D114	G-force	D114-16-0	The 1 g-force on an object sitting on the Earth's surface is caused by mechanical force exerted in the upward direction by the ground , keeping the object from going into free-fall.
Q114	D114	G-force	D114-17-0	The upward force from the ground ensures that an object at rest on the Earth's surface is accelerating relative to the free-fall condition, which is the path that the object would follow when falling freely toward the Earth's center.
Q114	D114	G-force	D114-18-0	Objects allowed to free-fall in an inertial trajectory under the influence of gravitation-only, feel no g-force.
Q114	D114	G-force	D114-19-0	This is demonstrated by the "zero-g" conditions inside a freely falling elevator falling toward the Earth's center (in vacuum), or (to good approximation) conditions inside a spacecraft in Earth orbit.
Q114	D114	G-force	D114-20-0	These are examples of coordinate acceleration (a change in velocity) without a sensation of weight.
Q114	D114	G-force	D114-21-0	The experience of no g-force (zero-g), however it is produced, is synonymous with weightlessness .
Q114	D114	G-force	D114-22-0	In the absence of gravitational fields, or in directions at right angles to them, proper and coordinate accelerations are the same, and any coordinate acceleration must be produced by a corresponding g-force acceleration.
Q114	D114	G-force	D114-23-0	An example here is a rocket in free space, in which simple changes in velocity are produced by the engines.

Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-0-0	Events involving meiosis, showing chromosomal crossover
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-1-0	Meiosis () is a special type of cell division necessary for sexual reproduction in eukaryotes .
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-2-0	The cells be produced by meiosis
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-3-0	In many organisms, including all animals and land plants (but not some other groups such as fungi ), gametes are called sperm and egg cells .
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-4-0	Whilst the process of meiosis bears a number of similarities with the 'life-cycle' cell division process of mitosis , it differs in two important respects:
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-5-0	the chromosomes in meiosis undergo a recombination which shuffles the genes producing a different genetic combination in each gamete, compared with the co-existence of each of the two separate pairs of each chromosome (one received from each parent) in each cell which results from mitosis.
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-6-0	four genetically unique haploid cells
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-6-1	cells be produced from mitosis
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-7-0	Meiosis begins with one diploid cell containing two copies of each chromosome —one from the organism's mother and one from its father.
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-8-0	The cell divides twice potentially producing up to four haploid cells containing one copy of each chromosome
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-8-1	The cell divides potentially producing up to four haploid cells containing one copy of each chromosome
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-9-0	("Potentially" because in some cases, such as the formation of oocytes in mammals, only one of the possible four haploid cells survives.)
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-10-0	In animals the haploid cell resulting from meiosis is a male or female gamete .
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-11-0	Each of the resulting chromosomes in the gamete cells is a unique mixture of maternal and paternal DNA, resulting in offspring that are genetically distinct from either parent.
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-12-0	This gives rise to genetic diversity in sexually reproducing populations.
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-13-0	This genetic diversity can provide the variation of physical and behavioural attributes ( phenotypes ) upon which natural selection can act, but, as described below in Section 6, Origin and function of meiosis, the genetic diversity may be largely a by-product of the homologous recombination that is primarily employed for its DNA repair function during meiosis.
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-14-0	It is also noteworthy that during meiosis, specific genes are more highly transcribed, and these are called the meiome, the term used in functional genomics for the meiotic transcriptome .
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-15-0	Meiosis is a key feature for all sexually reproducing eukaryotes in which homologous chromosome pairing, synapse and recombination occur.
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-16-0	In addition to strong meiotic stage-specific expression of mRNA (the meiome), however, there are also pervasive translational controls (e.g. selective usage of preformed mRNA), regulating the ultimate meiotic stage-specific protein expression of genes during meiosis.
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-17-0	Thus, both the meiome and translational controls determine the broad restructuring of meiotic cells needed to carry out meiosis.
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-18-0	the cell has chromosomes
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-19-0	In the beginning of meiosis the maternal and paternal homologs pair to each other.
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-20-0	Then they typically exchange parts by homologous recombination leading to crossovers of DNA between the maternal and paternal versions of the chromosome.
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-21-0	Spindle fibers bind to the centromeres of each pair of homologs and arrange the pairs at the spindle equator.
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-22-0	Then the fibers pull the recombined homologs to opposite poles of the cell.
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-23-0	the cell divides into two daughter cells As the chromosomes move away from the center
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-23-1	the cell divides into two daughter cells
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-24-0	After the recombined maternal and paternal homologs have separated into the two daughter cells, a second round of cell division occurs.
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-25-0	There meiosis ends as the two sister chromatids making up each homolog are separated and move into one of the four resulting gamete cells.
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-26-0	Upon fertilization , for example when a sperm enters an egg cell, two gamete cells produced by meiosis fuse.
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-27-0	The gamete from the mother and the gamete from the father each contribute one half of the set of chromosomes that make up the new offspring's genome .
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-28-0	Meiosis uses many of the same mechanisms as mitosis , a type of cell division used by eukaryotes like plants and animals to split one cell into two identical daughter cells.
Q497	D490	Meiosis	D490-29-0	In all plants and in many protists meiosis results in the formation of spores : haploid cells that can divide vegetatively without undergoing fertilization.
Q499	D492	Boxing	D492-0-0	Boxing (pugilism, prize fighting, the sweet science or in Greek pygmachia ) is a martial art and combat sport in which two people engage in a contest of strength, speed, reflexes, endurance and will by throwing punches with gloved hands .

Q856	D830	Vitamin	D830-1-0	A vitamin ( or ) is an organic compound required by an organism as a vital nutrient in limited amounts.
Q856	D830	Vitamin	D830-2-0	An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) is called a vitamin when it cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism, and must be obtained from the diet.
Q856	D830	Vitamin	D830-3-0	Thus, the term is conditional both on the circumstances and on the particular organism.
Q856	D830	Vitamin	D830-4-0	For example, ascorbic acid ( vitamin C ) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals, and biotin and vitamin D are required in the human diet only in certain circumstances.
Q856	D830	Vitamin	D830-5-0	By convention, the term vitamin includes neither other essential nutrients , such as dietary minerals , essential fatty acids , or essential amino acids (which are needed in larger amounts than vitamins) nor the large number of other nutrients that promote health but are otherwise required less often.
Q856	D830	Vitamin	D830-6-0	Thirteen vitamins are universally recognized at present.
Q856	D830	Vitamin	D830-7-0	Vitamins are classified by their biological and chemical activity, not their structure.

Q890	D860	Conservation of mass	D860-0-0	Antoine Lavoisier 's discovery of the Law of Conservation of Mass led to many new findings in the 19th century.
Q890	D860	Conservation of mass	D860-1-0	Joseph Proust 's law of definite proportions and John Dalton 's atomic theory branched from the discoveries of Antoine Lavoisier.
Q890	D860	Conservation of mass	D860-2-0	Lavoisier's quantitative experiments revealed that combustion involved oxygen rather than what was previously thought to be phlogiston .
Q890	D860	Conservation of mass	D860-3-0	The law of conservation of mass, or principle of mass conservation, states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter and energy (both of which have mass), the mass of the system must remain constant over time, as system mass cannot change quantity if it is not added or removed.
Q890	D860	Conservation of mass	D860-4-0	the quantity of mass is conserved
Q890	D860	Conservation of mass	D860-5-0	The law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed although it may be rearranged in space
Q890	D860	Conservation of mass	D860-6-0	The law implies that during any chemical reaction nuclear reaction or radioactive decay in an isolated system the mass of the reactants or starting material must equal the mass of the products
Q890	D860	Conservation of mass	D860-7-0	The concept of mass conservation is widely used in many fields such as chemistry , mechanics , and fluid dynamics .
Q890	D860	Conservation of mass	D860-8-0	Historically, mass conservation was discovered in chemical reactions by Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century, and was of crucial importance in the progress from alchemy to the modern natural science of chemistry .
Q890	D860	Conservation of mass	D860-9-0	The closely related concept of matter conservation was found to hold good in chemistry to such high approximation that it failed only for the high energies treated by the later refinements of relativity theory, but otherwise remains useful and sufficiently accurate for most chemical calculations, even in modern practice.
Q890	D860	Conservation of mass	D860-10-0	In special relativity , needed for accuracy when large energy transfers between systems is involved, the difference between thermodynamically closed and isolated systems becomes important, since conservation of mass is strictly and perfectly upheld only for so-called isolated systems , i.e. those completely isolated from all exchanges with the environment.
Q890	D860	Conservation of mass	D860-11-0	In this circumstance, the mass-energy equivalence theorem states that mass conservation is equivalent to total energy conservation, which is the first law of thermodynamics .
Q890	D860	Conservation of mass	D860-12-0	By contrast, for a thermodynamically closed system (i.e., one which is closed to exchanges of matter, but open to exchanges of non-material energy, such as heat and work, with the surroundings) mass is (usually) only approximately conserved.
Q890	D860	Conservation of mass	D860-13-0	The input or output of non-material energy must change the mass of the system in relativity theory, although the change is usually small, since relatively large amounts of such energy (by comparison with ordinary experience) carry only a small amount of mass (again by ordinary standards of measurement).
Q890	D860	Conservation of mass	D860-14-0	In special relativity, mass is not converted to energy, since energy in all of its forms always retains its equivalent amount of mass throughout any transformation or translocation into, or out of, a system.
Q890	D860	Conservation of mass	D860-15-0	matter is a different concept
Q890	D860	Conservation of mass	D860-16-0	However, if such energy is removed from systems, they must lose the mass that is associated with it.
Q890	D860	Conservation of mass	D860-17-0	In general relativity , mass (and energy) conservation in expanding volumes of space is a complex concept, subject to different definitions, and neither mass nor energy is as strictly and simply conserved as is the case in special relativity and in Minkowski space .
Q890	D860	Conservation of mass	D860-18-0	For a discussion, see mass in general relativity .

Q1629	D1546	Cell division	D1546-2-0	Cell division usually occurs as part of a larger cell cycle .
Q1629	D1546	Cell division	D1546-3-0	In eukaryotes , there are two distinct type of cell division: a vegetative division, whereby each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell ( mitosis ), and a reductive cell division, whereby the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half, to produce haploid gametes ( meiosis ).
Q1629	D1546	Cell division	D1546-4-0	Both of these cell division cycles are required in sexually reproducing organisms at some point in their life cycle, and both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor Prokaryotes also undergo a vegetative cell division known as binary fission , where their genetic material is segregated equally into two daughter cells.
Q1629	D1546	Cell division	D1546-5-0	All cell divisions, regardless of organism, are preceded by a single round of DNA replication .
Q1629	D1546	Cell division	D1546-6-0	For simple unicellular organisms such as the amoeba , one cell division is equivalent to reproduction – an entire new organism is created.

Q2016	D1902	Booting	D1902-0-0	In computing , booting (also known as booting up) is the initial set of operations that a computer system performs when electrical power to the CPU is switched on.
Q2016	D1902	Booting	D1902-1-0	The process begins when a computer is turned on for the first time or is re-energized after being turned off, and ends when the computer is ready to perform its normal operations.
Q2016	D1902	Booting	D1902-2-0	On modern general purpose computers, this can take tens of seconds and typically involves performing a power-on self-test , locating and initializing peripheral devices, and then finding, loading and starting an operating system .
Q2016	D1902	Booting	D1902-3-0	Many computer systems also allow these operations to be initiated by a software command without cycling power, in what is known as a soft reboot , though some of the initial operations might be skipped on a soft reboot.
Q2016	D1902	Booting	D1902-4-0	A boot loader is a computer program that loads the main operating system or runtime environment for the computer after completion of the self-tests.
Q2016	D1902	Booting	D1902-5-0	The computer term boot is short for bootstrap or bootstrap load and derives from the phrase to pull oneself up by one's bootstraps .
Q2016	D1902	Booting	D1902-6-0	The usage calls attention to the requirement that, if most software is loaded onto a computer by other software already running on the computer, some mechanism must exist to load initial software onto the computer.

Q2039	D1925	Mortality rate	D1925-3-0	Mortality rate is typically expressed in units of deaths per 1000 individuals per year; thus, a mortality rate of 9.5 (out of 1000) in a population of 1,000 would mean 9.5 deaths per year in that entire population, or 0.95% out of the total.
Q2039	D1925	Mortality rate	D1925-4-0	It is distinct from morbidity rate , which refers to the number of individuals in poor health during a given time period (the prevalence rate ) or the number of newly appearing cases of the disease per unit of time ( incidence rate ).

Q2460	D2304	Jetboat	D2304-1-0	water be ejected from the back of the craft
Q2460	D2304	Jetboat	D2304-2-0	Unlike a powerboat or motorboat that uses a propeller in the water below or behind the boat, a jetboat draws the water from under the boat into a pump inside the boat, then expels it through a nozzle at the stern .
Q2460	D2304	Jetboat	D2304-3-0	Jetboats were originally designed by Sir William Hamilton (who developed a waterjet in 1954) for operation in the fast-flowing and shallow rivers of New Zealand , specifically to overcome the problem of propellers striking rocks in such waters.
Q2460	D2304	Jetboat	D2304-4-0	Previous attempts at waterjet propulsion had very short lifetimes, generally due to the inefficient design of the units and the fact that they offered few advantages over conventional propellers.
Q2460	D2304	Jetboat	D2304-5-0	Unlike these previous waterjet developments, such as Campini's and the Hanley Hydrojet, Hamilton had a specific need for a propulsion system to operate in very-shallow water, and the waterjet proved to be the ideal solution.
Q2460	D2304	Jetboat	D2304-6-0	From this, the popularity of the jet unit and jetboat increased rapidly.
Q2460	D2304	Jetboat	D2304-7-0	Through further developments, it was found the waterjet offered several other advantages over propellers for a wide range of vessel types, and as such, waterjets are used widely today for many high-speed vessels, including passenger ferries, rescue craft, patrol boats and offshore supply vessels.
Q2460	D2304	Jetboat	D2304-8-0	Jetboats are highly maneuverable, and many can, from full speed, be reversed and brought to a stop within little more than their own length, in a maneuver known as a "crash stop".
Q2460	D2304	Jetboat	D2304-9-0	The well known Hamilton turn or "jet spin" is a high-speed maneuvre where the boat's engine throttle is cut, the steering is turned sharply and the throttle opened again, causing the boat to spin quickly around with a large spray of water.
Q2460	D2304	Jetboat	D2304-10-0	There is no engineering limit to the size of jetboats, though the validity of their use depends a lot on the type of application.
Q2460	D2304	Jetboat	D2304-11-0	Classic prop-drives are generally more efficient and economical at low speeds, up to about , but as boat speed increases beyond this, the extra hull resistance generated by struts, rudders , shafts (etc.) means waterjets are more efficient in the 20-50 knot range (up to ).
Q2460	D2304	Jetboat	D2304-12-0	Also, in situations with very large propellers turning at slow speeds (such as tug boats), the equivalent size waterjet would be too big to be practical.
Q2460	D2304	Jetboat	D2304-13-0	For these reasons, the vast majority of waterjet units are installed in high-speed vessels and in particular situations where shallow draught, maneuverability, and load flexibility are main concerns.
