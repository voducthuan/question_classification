Q813	D787	Diaphragm pump	D787-0-0	Diaphragm pump schematic.
Q813	D787	Diaphragm pump	D787-1-0	A diaphragm pump (also known as a Membrane pump, Air Operated Double Diaphragm Pump (AODD) or Pneumatic Diaphragm Pump) is a positive displacement pump that uses a combination of the reciprocating action of a rubber , thermoplastic or teflon diaphragm and suitable valves either side of the diaphragm ( check valve , butterfly valves, flap valves, or any other form of shut-off valves) to pump a fluid .
Q813	D787	Diaphragm pump	D787-2-0	There are three main types of diaphragm pumps:
Q813	D787	Diaphragm pump	D787-3-0	Those in which the diaphragm is sealed with one side in the fluid to be pumped, and the other in air or hydraulic fluid .
Q813	D787	Diaphragm pump	D787-4-0	The diaphragm is flexed, causing the volume of the pump chamber to increase and decrease.
Q813	D787	Diaphragm pump	D787-5-0	A pair of non-return check valves prevent reverse flow of the fluid.
Q813	D787	Diaphragm pump	D787-6-0	Those employing volumetric positive displacement where the prime mover of the diaphragm is electro-mechanical, working through a crank or geared motor drive, or purely mechanical, such as with a lever or handle.
Q813	D787	Diaphragm pump	D787-7-0	This method flexes the diaphragm through simple mechanical action, and one side of the diaphragm is open to air.
Q813	D787	Diaphragm pump	D787-8-0	Those employing one or more unsealed diaphragms with the fluid to be pumped on both sides.
Q813	D787	Diaphragm pump	D787-9-0	The diaphragm(s) again are flexed, causing the volume to change.
Q813	D787	Diaphragm pump	D787-10-0	When the volume of a chamber of either type of pump is increased (the diaphragm moving up), the pressure decreases, and fluid is drawn into the chamber.
Q813	D787	Diaphragm pump	D787-11-0	When the chamber pressure later increases from decreased volume (the diaphragm moving down), the fluid previously drawn in is forced out.
Q813	D787	Diaphragm pump	D787-12-0	Finally, the diaphragm moving up once again draws fluid into the chamber, completing the cycle.
Q813	D787	Diaphragm pump	D787-13-0	This action is similar to that of the cylinder in an internal combustion engine .
